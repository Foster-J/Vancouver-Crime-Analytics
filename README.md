Vancouver Crime Analystics Pipeline
-----------------------------------
A complete data analytics project analyzing crime statistics in Vancouver, BC. 
This project transforms raw crime data into insights through a ETL pipeline, SQL analystics and interactive visualizations using Power BI dashboards.

Project Overview
----------------
I built a full data pipeline from scratch by extracting data from the Vancouver Police Department's open data portal.
The data has been cleaned and transformed using Python with Pandas and numPy.
Cleaned and transformed data was then stored in a structured SQL database using SQLite3.
The data was then imported into Microsoft Power BI to create an interactive dashboard.
